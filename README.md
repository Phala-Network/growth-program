## How the Ambassador Program works:

1. Understand the Token Allocation (of the $PHA token pool) for each department:
   - Basic Responsibilities (10%)
   - Community Management (25%)
   - Marketing (20%)
   - Content Creation (20%)
   - Business Development (10%)
   - Tech Assistance (10%)
   - Others (5%)
   - Additional Promotional Bonus (outside of the token pool)
     - Head Ambs: 4000 $PHA/month
     - Senior Ambs: 2000 $PHA/month

2. Choose Your Tasks:
   - Ambassadors will have to choose at least two and can choose up to three departments, out of the five departments (CM, MK, CC, BD & Tech), to work on each month.
   - There is a total of 40 points per month per department - 20 points for efforts and 20 points for results.
   - Ambassadors will be able to seek support from their regional team leaders while executing the tasks.
  
3. Evaluation:
   - Contribution will be evaluated on a monthly basis; Points will be calculated based on the evidence submitted in Ambassadors' monthly Github issues.
   - Submit your contribution by creating an issue on this repository latest by the 5th day of the following month. Any late submission will not be accepted.
   - Any ambassador candidates, who reach at least 65% points for a period of 3 consecutive months, will be promoted to the official ambassador position.
   - Any official ambassador, who reaches at least 90% points for a period of 3 consecutive months, will become a Senior Ambassador.

4. Ambassadors will receive individual scores for their work in each department. The percentage of an ambassador's score relative to the total scores given in that department will determine the amount of $PHA awarded for that task. For example, if Ambassador A scores 30 points in CM out of a total of 240 points, 28 in CC out of 180, and 35 in MK out of 200, and because the CM task is allocated 25% of the token pool, CC 20% and MK 20%, then Ambassador A's $PHA reward will be calculated as follows: 

$$
\left(\frac{30}{240}\right) \times (84,000 \times 0.25) + \left(\frac{28}{180}\right) \times (84,000 \times 0.20) + \left(\frac{35}{200}\right) \times (84,000 \times 0.20) 
$$
  
5. Receive $PHA Rewards:
   - For every 5 new Ambassadors joining the program, an additional 21,000 $PHA will be added to the token pool.
   - The reward pool comes from the PHA [Treasury](https://phala.subscan.io/account/41PLCEdup7XdUH4hsik4hyFoihDRYKfpN2K48jZH8ehL2tP2).
   - The token allocation to each department may change depending on how the recruitment goes.
   - Future $PHA will ONLY be distributed to the ambassadors' addresses on Phala Network.

6. Ambassador hierarchy:
   - Our structure: candidate, ambassador, senior ambassador, and head ambassador.
   - Your starting position will depend on how well your application meets our criteria: expertise, commitment and influence.

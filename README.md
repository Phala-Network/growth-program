# Ambassador Reward System- Updated June 2022

## How does the program work?
1. There will be basic tasks and supplementary tasks every month.
2. Basic tasks are mandatory and will be recurring.
3. Supplementary tasks are optional, which you can choose depending on your skills and talent. You can choose to do up to 2 different supplementary tasks in a month.
4. Each task is given specific points and you need to achieve at least 40% of the total points to qualify to receive the rewards.
5. If you achieve 100%, you will get the full rewards. If you achieve only 50%, you will get half of the full rewards.
6. If there are surplus PHA in a particular month, it will be distributed equally to those who achieved ≥90%.
7. In case that there is a surplus PHA and no one achieves ≥90%, the surplus PHA will be carried forward to the next month.
8. It is MANDATORY for each ambassador to participate. Failure to achieve at least 40% points for a period of 3 consecutive months will result in the termination of your ambassadorship.
9. Any ambassador candidates, who reach at least 40% points for a period of 3 consecutive months, will receive a hardware mining-node as a reward and get promoted to the official ambassador position (you may choose the promotion reward between a hardware or in equivalent amount of PHA token, if you are running a node on your own without the hardware provided)
10. Any official ambassadors, who reach at least 80% points for a period of 3 consecutive months, will become Senior Ambassadors and receive an additional full-cap delegation with 50% pool-operations fee along with a Phala Swag Box.
11. In case that you do a group work with other ambassadors e.g. We have 2 ambassadors from France and they jointly organized a local meetup, please submit your contribution individually (stating that it is a group work). This is to avoid confusion. Points will be given individually.
12. An example of how the calculation works can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QsQUwl_pArltaJvJkZ66EUTgNpLyfRgV/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100574805470537994931&rtpof=true&sd=true).
13. The reward pool comes from the PHA [Treasury](https://khala.subscan.io/account/436H4jat8E3x6whTRudzJFuF1aFqkxmkYyQqNbh9C9EKhcz7). The reward pool may change depending on how much it is getting.

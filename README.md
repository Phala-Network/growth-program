## Ambassador Responsibilities:   

1. Community Management (CM):
   - Online Community Moderation: Monitor and manage Phalaâ€™s online community platforms (e.g., Discord, Telegram, Twitter, Reddit, etc.) to ensure conversations remain respectful, inclusive, and aligned with community guidelines. Install and configure moderation bots or tools as necessary to streamline community management and automate repetitive tasks. Actively address and resolve conflicts, misinformation, or inappropriate behavior in a timely and diplomatic manner, helping to maintain a safe and welcoming space for all members.
   - Translation and Localization: Support the growth of Phalaâ€™s global community by translating official announcements, technical documents, blog posts, and other content into local languages. Ensure translations are accurate and culturally sensitive, allowing non-English speaking members to access, understand, and participate in the ecosystem more effectively. Collaborate with other Ambassadors or regional teams to ensure consistency and coverage across key regions.

2. Content Creation (CC):
   - Informative and Engaging Content: Create a variety of content formats such as blog posts, newsletters, Twitter threads, social media updates, educational videos, and technical tutorials. The aim is to inform and engage the community while promoting Phalaâ€™s mission, progress, and ecosystem news. Work closely with the marketing team to align content with broader campaigns and ensure messaging is consistent and impactful.
   - Visual and Multimedia Production: Design and produce high-quality visual content including original illustrations, AI-generated art, infographics, animations, short-form videos, and other multimedia assets. These should align with Phalaâ€™s branding guidelines and help convey complex ideas in an accessible and visually appealing manner. Your creative work may be used across social media, event presentations, product launches, and marketing campaigns.
  
3. Business Development (BD):
   - Lead Generation and Pipeline Building: Identify potential partners and project opportunities that align with Phalaâ€™s vision. Build and maintain a structured pipeline to track and qualify project leads, using scoring techniques or predefined metrics to evaluate quality and strategic fit.
   - Outreach and Relationship Management: Proactively reach out to potential collaborators, projects, and organizations to explore partnership opportunities. Establish and nurture strong, long-term relationships that support Phalaâ€™s growth and ecosystem expansion. Maintain regular communication and report potential partnership progress to the Business Development team.
   - Collaboration with BD Team: Work hand-in-hand with Phalaâ€™s Business Development team to define strategic goals, share lead insights, and ensure a seamless handoff of qualified leads. Act as a bridge between external stakeholders and internal teams, helping to facilitate effective engagement and deal progression.

4. Others:
   - Regional Leadership: Serve as a Regional Team Leader by coordinating activities in your specific region. This includes mentoring local Ambassadors, organizing regional events (both online and offline), and acting as the main point of contact for your area.
   - Exceptional Contributions: Go beyond assigned duties by contributing in unique and impactful waysâ€”such as organizing community initiatives, hackathons, AMAs, or acting as a spokesperson for Phala in conferences and online forums. These efforts will be recognized and factored into your monthly performance evaluations.

## How the Ambassador Program works:

1. Understand the Token Allocation (of the $PHA token pool) for each department :
   - Community Management (35%)
   - Content Creation (40%)
   - Business Development (20%)
   - Others (5%)
   - Additional Promotional Bonus (outside of the token pool)
     - Head Ambs: 4000 $PHA/month
     - Senior Ambs: 2000 $PHA/month
   ðŸ“Œ Note: The allocation percentages above are guidelines and may be adjusted based on the number of active contributors in each department and the evolving needs of Phala Networkâ€™s business priorities. Flexibility allows us to reward impact and ensure sustainable growth across all areas.

2. Choose Your Tasks:
   - Ambassadors will have to choose at least two and can choose up to three departments, out of the five departments (CM, CC & BD), to work on each month.
   - There is a total of 40 points per month per department - 20 points for the efforts and 20 points for the results.
   - Ambassadors will be able to seek support from their regional team leaders while executing the tasks.
  
3. Evaluation:
   - Contribution will be evaluated on a monthly basis; Points will be calculated based on the evidence submitted in Ambassadors' monthly Github issues.
   - Submit your contribution by creating an issue on this repository latest by the 5th day of the following month. Any late submission will not be accepted.
   - Any ambassador candidates, who reach at least 65% points for a period of 3 consecutive months, will be promoted to the official ambassador position.
   - Any official ambassador, who reaches at least 90% points for a period of 3 consecutive months, will become a Senior Ambassador.

4. Understand Reward Calculation:
   - Here is an example of calculating the total scores given in a department: Letâ€™s say 5 Ambassadors (Amb A, B, C, D, and E) choose to work on Community Management for that month and have received the following scores: 
     - Amb A: 38
     - Amb B: 32
     - Amb C: 20
     - Amb D: 25
     - Amb E: 30
     - The total score is therefore 38 + 32 + 20 + 25 + 30 = 145. Amb Aâ€™s reward, out of the token pool allocated to Community Management (35%), will then be: $$\left(\frac{38}{145}\right)$$ 
   - Ambassadors will receive individual scores for their work in each department. The percentage of an ambassador's score relative to the total scores given in that department will determine the amount of $PHA awarded for that task. For example, if Ambassador A scores 30 points in CM out of a total of 240 points, 28 in CC out of 180, and because the CM task is allocated 35% of the token pool, and CC 40%, then Ambassador A's $PHA reward will be calculated as follows: 

$$
\left(\frac{30}{240}\right) \times (90,000 \times 0.35) + \left(\frac{28}{180}\right) \times (90,000 \times 0.40)
$$

5. Receive $PHA Rewards:
   - For every 5 new Ambassadors joining the program, an additional 21,000 $PHA will be added to the token pool.
   - The reward pool comes from the PHA [Treasury](https://phala.subscan.io/account/41PLCEdup7XdUH4hsik4hyFoihDRYKfpN2K48jZH8ehL2tP2).
   - The token allocation to each department may change depending on how the recruitment goes.
   - Future $PHA will ONLY be distributed to the ambassadors' wallet addresses on Phala Network.

6. Ambassador hierarchy:
   - Our structure: candidate, ambassador, senior ambassador, and head ambassador.
   - Your starting position will depend on how well your application meets our criteria: expertise, commitment and influence.

1.	Tasks:
-	Both mandatory and supplementary tasks are available.
-	ALL mandatory tasks must be completed monthly.
-	Supplementary tasks are optional but encouraged.
-	Mandatory tasks will vary, depending on your chosen departments.
- You must choose two departments: marketing, community or content.
-	A maximum of 2 different supplementary tasks can be completed, per month.

2. Points:

-	There is a total of 100 points per month.
-	The total amount of points awarded to departments are 80 (80/100). 
-	The total amount of points awarded to supplementary tasks are 20 (20/100). 
-	You can choose the point-weight of each department. For example, if you choose Marketing and Content, Marketing can be worth 90% and Content can be worth 10% of the total available 80 points for departments.  
-	The point-weight of supplementary tasks can vary per month, depending on Phala’s needs. 

3. Rewards:
-	You need to achieve at least 40% of the total points (40/100) to quality to receive rewards.
-	If you achieve 100%, you will get the full rewards. If you achieve only 50%, you will get half of the full rewards.
-	If there is surplus PHA in a particular month, it will be distributed equally to those who achieved ≥90%.
-	If there is surplus PHA and no one achieves ≥90%, it will be carried forward to the next month.
-	An example of how the calculation works can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QsQUwl_pArltaJvJkZ66EUTgNpLyfRgV/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100574805470537994931&rtpof=true&sd=true).

4. Ambassador hierarchy: 
-	Our structure: advocate, candidate, ambassador, senior ambassador, and head ambassador.
-	All successful applicants to our ambassador programme will begin as either an advocate or a candidate.

5. Scores:
-	Participation is MANDATORY. Failure to achieve at least 40% points for a period of 3 consecutive months will result in the termination of your ambassadorship.
